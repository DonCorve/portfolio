                <p>
                    Ever since I was a child, I was creative, curious and special <s>in the head</s>. Making cars with matchsticks, carving skeletons out of chalk and painting fake currency back in school, but my digital journey began around 8th grade. When I came back from school all I could think about was games and TV shows (OG cartoon network), but I was quickly banned from using the computer.. unless I was using it to fiddle with software.<br><br>I took that oppotunity and there I was, sitting infront of Autodesk 3Ds max, reading user manual (this is dial-up times, you couldn't just find tutorials on youtube <s>swear you kids have it easy these days</s>) to create a starfighter spaceship out of a box. I was hooked, my uncle taught me how to set keyframes and that was it, bunch of files with horrible topology models and crappy workflow. I animated a bayblade battle and modeled a lamborghini that looked like it was made out of cardboard. <br><br> So, what's the point of this story? these files are what got me enrolled into a post secondary 3Ds max course at Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics, before I even completed my secondary education. And that was how I got my first professional tuition into the digital world.

						<p>As a proposal for an art installation for a corporate house.</p>
					  <p>There was an employee waiting room, in which, the columns resembled trees. So, <i>The Sacred Grove</i> was proposed, a conceptual augmented reality game in which the objective was to protect the last surviving trees on Earth. The goal was to provide a peek into an imaginative world of Augmented Reality. </p>

				<div class="overlay"><div class="card"><h2>The tree</h2><p>To fit into the concept the tree needed to be old and dense. Finding the right asset that fit the description was not so hard, but the next challenge was to make it look alive.<br><br> There was no actual wind or force wrap used here, to simulate the rustling of leaves, I separated the trunk from the leaves in <strong>3Ds max</strong> and added a noise modifier on the leaves. While keeping the leaves and trunk grouped, I added a bend modifier ontop and animated it to simulate the effect of swaying. </p></div><div class="card"><h2>the bird</h2><p>Similarly I had to first find a fully textured and rigged bird, and fortunately I did. The interesting thing about the bird here is that it actually isn't moving in 3D space at all.<br><br> I animated the bird in <strong>Maya</strong> and exported out an image sequence, then I imported the image sequence in <strong>After Effects</strong> to animate the path and scale. This gives you more flexibility and control over the path of the bird. I would not advice to do this if the camera was not steady and the environment was 3D.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>the Fruits</h2><p>These forms were supposed to be installed physically on the columns which then disappear when viewed through the Augmented Reality game application.<br><br>Vyom gave me sketches and clay models to start with, after which I made the meshes in <strong>Zbrush</strong> and then refined them. Once we selected the final forms, I imported them in <strong>3Ds max</strong> for final renders. The meshes are only box mapped, there was no time or need to unwrap them as they were not going to be up-close to the camera.</p></div></div>

				<div class="overlay"><div class="card"><h2>Initial Idea</h2><p>I believe that trees represent growth, life and endurance.<br><br>The concept I have in-play here is that, the tree represents the beginning of a new relationship. Reddish hue in the leaves indicates the essence of life, as it becomes precious and eternal, depicted here by the color gold. <br><br> The vision I had for the final look consisted of ornamental elements and flourishing animations. For the overall look and feel I wanted to aim for a hand drawn storybook style. </p></div><div class="card"><h2>The flourish</h2><p>In this shot, there is an upward panning motion which slowly reveals the elements in this scene as the audience is taken on a journey into the story. In addition, there is an overlay of welcoming text with similar style animation.<br><br>The heirarchy of assets is complex, but mainly there are 3 aspects, the background, the tree, and the overlay. The background reveals itself with the use of an Alpha Matte, while the other two are using a Stroke Effect to achieve this. The tree itself has multiple layers that use the same technique to reveal with a delay.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>The journey</h2><p>Then, from a freshly bloomed flower on the tree, a Hummingbird carries the news to spread it across the world.<br><br> The bird is a rig system, composed of 3D layers, made in <strong>After Effects</strong> itself. The wings are operating on a wiggle expression after defining the origin of each layer. Then, the main body is a puppet mesh with pins that operate on a wiggle expression also. Lastly, the rig system was animated as needed.<br><br>At the end of this shot, the cards then fall out of the bags. The story is continued in the following section.</p></div></div>

				<div class="overlay"><div class="card"><h2>The fall</h2><p>As the cards are falling they are displayed on the screen with time, venue and dates of the upcoming events, the left side is for the groom's guests and the right side is for the bride's guests. When there is a single card it means the schedule is common between the both. This was done using a plug-in for 3D in <strong>After Effects</strong> which had a lot of bugs with rendering. Hence, I would prefer and recommend to use a 3d software package over this approach. <br><br>The last frame of this video there is a close-up of the logo, this serves as a transition for the next video in queue when the first family is called on stage.<br><br>Please note the video is sped up by <strong>4x</strong> for display purpose.</p></div><div class="card"><h2>Groom</h2><p>Once the first family is called on stage, the next video is triggered by them. Following the storyline the card then falls onto a table where the invitee's name is magically written, after an auspiscious tradition is performed. <br><br> The bird here is a different rig, created the same way as the other. For the feather I set the origin to it's pointy end, and wrote a wiggle expression in its orientation, then drew a path to simulate the writing. <br><br> The video pauses at a frame where the bird appears at rest to serve for the next transition. </p></div><div class="card"><h2>Bride</h2><p>Upon announced, the second family approaches the stage to trigger the next video. Only this time, there are a few tweaks and additions to keep the seamlessness intact.<br><br>Then a second variation for Groom's card, without the card falling and the bird's entry, is then played for the next family. Finally, this brings us back to bride's video. Now a complete loop is formed, with 50 personalized text and tweaks for each party's guests the event is complete. Special thanks to that neighbour who volunteered to be my hand model. Thank you.. for <i>reaching out.</i><br><br> For your.. <i>helping hand.</i><br>It was <i>handy. </i></p></div></div>
